# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sunday 13th August
**Today's Progress**: Spent a large chunk of today installing ubuntu on my laptop and the remainder looking through some basic git tutorials.

**Thoughts:**: Running git from the terminal is a lot more complicated than running Github desktop on Windows. Going to take some getting used to but should enable me to push to github more regularly and make me more accountable going forwards.
