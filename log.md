# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sunday 13th August
**Today's Progress**: Spent a large chunk of today installing ubuntu on my laptop and the remainder looking through some basic git tutorials.

**Thoughts:**: Running git from the terminal is a lot more complicated than running Github desktop on Windows. Going to take some getting used to but should enable me to push to github more regularly and make me more accountable going forwards.

### Day 2: Tuesday 13th September
**Today's Progress**: Built most of the javascript functions for a working copy of Simon in the web browser. Functionality is all there, just need to work on the look now.

**Thoughts:**: Remembering the difference between =, == and === is a sticking point for me. Also, been better at keeping comments about what my code is doing this time.
Big gap between day 1 and day 2 due to holidays and work.
Should be back on track from now on.
